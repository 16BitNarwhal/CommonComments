588,I never see anyone talk about this but it’s interesting to me. This was filmed on the New York Street set at Fox Studios in LA. Many TV shows have been filmed there. You can even catch a glimpse of Maclaren’s Pub from How I Met Your Mother at 3:04. You can also see the Royal Diner from Bones just a few frames later. I’m pretty sure both can be seen in an episode of Its Always Sunny as well. There’s probably more that I’m forgetting that were filmed on this set. But those were the two that caught my eye
